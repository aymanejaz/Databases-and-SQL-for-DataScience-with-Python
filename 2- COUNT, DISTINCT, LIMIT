---------------------------- Exercise 1: COUNT ---------------------------- 

SELECT * FROM FilmLocations;

-- In this example, suppose we want to count the number of records or rows of the “FilmLocations” table.

-- Problem:
-- Retrieve the number of rows from the “FilmLocations” table.
-- Solution:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM FilmLocations;

SELECT Count(*) FROM FilmLocations WHERE ReleaseYear<1950;


---------------------------- Exercise 2: DISTINCT ---------------------------- 

-- In this example, we want to retrieve the title of all films in the table in such a way that duplicates will be discarded in the output resultset.

-- Problem:
-- Retrieve the name of all films without any repeated titles.
-- Solution:
SELECT DISTINCT Title FROM FilmLocations;

-- Problem:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT Distributor) FROM FilmLocations WHERE Actor1="Clint Eastwood";


---------------------------- Exercise 3: LIMIT ---------------------------- 

-- In this example, let us retrieve a specific number of rows from the top of the table in such a way that rows other than those are not in the output resultset.

-- Problem:
-- Retrieve the first 25 rows from the “FilmLocations” table.
-- Solution:
SELECT * FROM FilmLocations LIMIT 25;


-- In this example, let us take the first example to a more advanced level. Now we want to retrieve a specific number of rows from the table, but thid time, not from the top of the table. This time we want to retrieve a specific number of rows starting from a specific row in the table.

-- Problem:
-- Retrieve the first 15 rows from the “FilmLocations” table starting from row 11.

-- Solution:
SELECT * FROM FilmLocations LIMIT 15 OFFSET 10;


-- Problem:
-- Retrieve the name of first 50 films distinctly.

SELECT DISTINCT Title FROM FilmLocations LIMIT 50;

-- Problem:
-- Retrieve first 10 film names distinctly released in 2015.
SELECT DISTINCT Title FROM FilmLocations WHERE ReleaseYear=2015 LIMIT 10;


-- Problem:

-- Retrieve the next 3 film names distinctly after first 5 films released in 2015.
SELECT DISTINCT Title FROM FilmLocations WHERE ReleaseYear=2015 LIMIT 3 OFFSET 5;
