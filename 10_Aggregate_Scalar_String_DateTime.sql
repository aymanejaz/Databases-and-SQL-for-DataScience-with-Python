select AVG(COST) from PETRESCUE;

-- Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
select AVG(COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Dog';



---------------------- Exercise 3: Scalar and String Functions ----------------------

-- Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
select ROUND(COST) from PETRESCUE;


-- Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
select LENGTH(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;


Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.

Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.

Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.
