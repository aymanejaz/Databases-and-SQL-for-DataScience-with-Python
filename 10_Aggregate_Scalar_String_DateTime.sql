---------------------- Exercise 1: Import csv file to phpmyadmin DB----------------------
-- add to phpmyadmin table name: mysql_learners
-- https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DB0201EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/MySQL/week3/PETRESCUE-CREATE.sql


---------------------- Exercise 2: Aggregate Functions ----------------------

-- Query A1: Enter a function that calculates the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table.

SELECT SUM(COST) from petrescue;

-- Query A2: Enter a function that displays the total cost of all animal rescues in the PETRESCUE table in a column called SUM_OF_COST.
SELECT SUM(COST) as SUM_OF_COST from petrescue;


-- Query A3: Enter a function that displays the maximum quantity of animals rescued.
select MAX(QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE;

-- Query A4: Enter a function that displays the average cost of animals rescued.
select AVG(COST) from PETRESCUE;

-- Query A5: Enter a function that displays the average cost of rescuing a dog.
select AVG(COST/QUANTITY) from PETRESCUE where ANIMAL = 'Dog';



---------------------- Exercise 3: Scalar and String Functions ----------------------

-- Query B1: Enter a function that displays the rounded cost of each rescue.
select ROUND(COST) from PETRESCUE;


-- Query B2: Enter a function that displays the length of each animal name.
select LENGTH(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;


-- Query B3: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase.
select UCASE(ANIMAL) from PETRESCUE;
SELECT UPPER(ANIMAL) FROM `petrescue`; --works both of them

-- Query B4: Enter a function that displays the animal name in each rescue in uppercase without duplications.
select DISTINCT(UCASE(ANIMAL)) from PETRESCUE;

-- Query B5: Enter a query that displays all the columns from the PETRESCUE table, where the animal(s) rescued are cats. Use cat in lower case in the query.

-- step-1   all colums of cat 
select * from PETRESCUE 
WHERE ANIMAL = 'cat';

-- Use cat in lower case in the query.
select * from PETRESCUE WHERE LCASE(ANIMAL) = 'cat';


---------------------- Exercise 4: Date and Time Functions ----------------------

-- Query C1: Enter a function that displays the day of the month when cats have been rescued.
SELECT DAY(RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE WHERE ANIMAL = 'cat';


-- Query C2: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 5th month.
SELECT SUM(Quantity) from PETRESCUE WHERE MONTH(RESCUEDATE) = '05';

-- Query C3: Enter a function that displays the number of rescues on the 14th day of the month.
SELECT SUM(Quantity) from PETRESCUE WHERE DAY(RESCUEDATE) = '14';

-- Query C4: Animals rescued should see the vet within three days of arrivals. Enter a function that displays the third day from each rescue.
select DATE_add(RESCUEDATE, INTERVAL 3 DAY) from PETRESCUE;


-- Query C5: Enter a function that displays the length of time the animals have been rescued; the difference between todayâ€™s date and the rescue date.
select DATEDIFF(CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,RESCUEDATE) from PETRESCUE;
